It belongs to the family Sinipercidae, which is closely related to the well-known North American sunfish family Centrarchidae. Determining the genome sequence of S. knerii would provide a foundation for better examining its genetic diversity and population history. A novel sequenced genome of the Sinipercidae also would help in comparative study of the Centrarchidae using Siniperca as a reference. Here, we determined the genome sequence of S. knerii using 10x Genomics technology and next-generation sequencing. Paired-end sequencing on a half lane of HiSeq X platform generated 56 Gbp of raw data. Read assembly using Supernova assembler resulted in two haplotype genomes with 732.1 Mb in size and an average GC content of 40.4%, which is consistent with genome size previously reported or estimated using k-mer counting. A total of 7,989 scaffolds with an N50 score of 12.64 Mb were obtained. The longest scaffold was 30.54 Mb. Evaluation of the genome completeness using BUSCO confirmed that 96.5% genes of the Actinopterygii Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs were found in the assembled genome of S. knerii. Gene prediction using Maker annotation kit resulted in 28,440 genes, of which 25,899 genes had at least one hit comparing to the NCBI Nr database, KEGG or InterProScan5. Pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) analysis of the genome showed that there was a bottleneck event of the population of S. knerii between 70 ka – 20 ka, which was concordant with the Tali glacier period, suggesting a population decline of S. knerii probably due to climate conditions.","Siniperca,knerii,Chinese,perch,Genome,sequencing,Genome,assembly,10x,Genomics","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/877.full"

Here we present a de novo genome assembly and annotation of D. bifasciata, a species which represents an important subgroup for which no high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly currently exists. We combined long-read sequencing (Nanopore) and Hi-C scaffolding to achieve a highly contiguous genome assembly approximately 193 Mb in size, with repetitive elements constituting 30.1% of the total length. Drosophila bifasciata harbors four large metacentric chromosomes and the small dot, and our assembly contains each chromosome in a single scaffold, including the highly repetitive pericentromeres, which were largely composed of Jockey and Gypsy transposable elements. We annotated a total of 12,821 protein-coding genes and comparisons of synteny with D. athabasca orthologs show that the large metacentric pericentromeric regions of multiple chromosomes are conserved between these species. Importantly, Muller A (X chromosome) was found to be metacentric in D. bifasciata and the pericentromeric region appears homologous to the pericentromeric region of the fused Muller A-AD (XL and XR) of pseudoobscura/affinis subgroup species. Our finding suggests a metacentric ancestral X fused to a telocentric Muller D and created the large neo-X (Muller A-AD) chromosome ~15 MYA. We also confirm the fusion of Muller C and D in D. bifasciata and show that it likely involved a centromere-centromere fusion.","chromosome,Muller,element,centromere,Nanopore","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/891.full"

Despite this economic impact, genomic resources have only been generated for a small number of aphid species. The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) was the third aphid species to have its genome sequenced and the first to use long-read sequence data. However, version 1 of the soybean aphid genome assembly has low contiguity (contig N50 = 57 Kb, scaffold N50 = 174 Kb), poor representation of conserved genes and the presence of genomic scaffolds likely derived from parasitoid wasp contamination. Here, I use recently developed methods to reassemble the soybean aphid genome. The version 2 genome assembly is highly contiguous, containing half of the genome in only 40 scaffolds (contig N50 = 2.00 Mb, scaffold N50 = 2.51 Mb) and contains 11% more conserved single-copy arthropod genes than version 1. To demonstrate the utility of this improved assembly, I identify a region of conserved synteny between aphids and Drosophila containing members of the Osiris gene family that was split over multiple scaffolds in the original assembly. The improved genome assembly and annotation of A. glycines demonstrates the benefit of applying new methods to old data sets and will provide a useful resource for future comparative genome analysis of aphids.","aphid,crop,pest,genome,evolution,Hemiptera,synteny","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/899.full"

Beyond of being a comprehensive phylogenetic group for studying intra-genus evolution of several traits like sex determination, behavior, morphology or adaptation through comparative genomic approaches, all medaka species share many advantages of experimental model organisms including small size and short generation time, transparent embryos and genome editing tools for reverse and forward genetic studies. The Java medaka, Oryzias javanicus, is one of the two species of medaka perfectly adapted for living in brackish/sea-waters. Being an important component of the mangrove ecosystem, O. javanicus is also used as a valuable marine test-fish for ecotoxicology studies. Here, we sequenced and assembled the whole genome of O. javanicus, and anticipate this resource will be catalytic for a wide range of comparative genomic, phylogenetic and functional studies. Complementary sequencing approaches including long-read technology and data integration with a genetic map allowed the final assembly of 908 Mbp of the O. javanicus genome. Further analyses estimate that the O. javanicus genome contains 33% of repeat sequences and has a heterozygosity of 0.96%. The achieved draft assembly contains 525 scaffolds with a total length of 809.7 Mbp, a N50 of 6,3 Mbp and a L50 of 37 scaffolds.

In this experimental pipeline, it is crucial to start by inducing a large number of random mutations in the genome of the model organism to search for phenotypes of interest. Many chemical mutagens are used to this end because most of them display particular reactivity properties and act differently over DNA. Here we report the use of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) as a mutagen in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. As opposed to many other alkylating agents, ENU only induces an SN1-type reaction with a low s constant (s = 0.26), attacking preferentially O2 and O4 in thymine and O6 deoxyguanosine, leading to base substitutions rather than indels, which are extremely rare in its resulting mutagenic repertoire. Using ENU, we gathered a collection of 13 temperature-sensitive mutants and 80 auxotrophic mutants including two deleterious alleles of the human ortholog ATIC. Defective alleles of this gene cause AICA-ribosiduria, a severe genetic disease. In this screen, we also identified 13 aminoglycoside-resistance inactivating mutations in APH genes. Mutations reported here may be of interest for metabolism related diseases and antibiotic resistance research fields.","S.pombe,N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea,mutagenesis,auxotrophy,ATIC,ribosiduria,phosphotransferase,Ade10","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/917.full"

The subset of traits that were measured in both cohorts (locomotor activity, body weight, and coat color) showed high genetic correlations, although the SNP heritabilities were slightly lower in the F39-43 cohort. For this subset of traits, we attempted to replicate loci identified in either F34 or F39-43 in the other cohort. Coat color was robustly replicated; locomotor activity and body weight were only partially replicated, which was inconsistent with our power simulations. We used a random effects model to show that the partial replications could not be explained by Winner’s Curse but could be explained by study-specific heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, we performed a mega-analysis by combining F34 and F39-43 cohorts (n = 1,028), which identified four novel loci associated with locomotor activity and body weight. These results illustrate that even with the high degree of genetic and environmental control possible in our experimental system, replication was hindered by study-specific heterogeneity, which has broad implications for ongoing concerns about reproducibility.","GWAS,Mouse,Genetics,Replication,Multiparent,Advanced,Generation,Inter-Cross,(MAGIC),multiparental,populations,MPP","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/951.full"

In virgins, the absence of a female germline results in expression changes in genes with known roles in nutrient homeostasis. At one- and three-day(s) post-mating, genes that change expression are enriched with those that function in metabolic pathways, in all conditions. We systematically examine female post-mating impacts on sleep, food preference and re-mating, in the strains and time points used for gene expression analyses and compare to published studies. We show that post-mating, gene expression changes vary by strain, prompting us to examine variation in female re-mating. We perform a genome-wide association study that identifies several DNA polymorphisms, including four in/near Wnt signaling pathway genes.

These elements typically reside distal to their target promoter, with which they must interact selectively. Additional elements may contribute to enhancer-promoter specificity, including remote control element sequences within enhancers, tethering elements near promoters, and insulator/boundary elements that disrupt off-target interactions. However, few of these elements have been mapped, and as a result, the mechanisms by which these elements interact remain poorly understood. One impediment is their method of study, namely reporter transgenes in which enhancers are placed adjacent to a heterologous promoter, which may circumvent mechanisms controlling enhancer-promoter specificity and long-range interactions. Here, we report an optimized dual reporter transgene system in Drosophila melanogaster that allows the simultaneous comparison of an enhancer’s ability to activate proximal and distal fluorescent reporter genes. Testing a panel of fluorescent transgenes in vivo, we found a two-protein combination that allows simultaneous measurement with minimal detection interference. We note differences among four tested enhancers in their ability to regulate a distally placed reporter transgene. These results suggest that enhancers differ in their requirements for promoter interaction and raise important practical considerations when studying enhancer function.","enhancer,remote,control,element,promoter,tethering,element,Drosophila","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/985.full"

Studies in Drosophila melanogaster, driven by the power of genetic screens, pioneered the discovery and characterization of many genes and pathways involved in DNA repair in animals. However, fewer than half of the alleles identified in these screens have been mapped to a specific gene, leaving a potential for new discoveries in this field. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized mutagen sensitive gene mus302 codes for the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger and WD domain protein 3 (RFWD3). In human cells, RFWD3 promotes ubiquitylation of RPA and RAD51 to facilitate repair of collapsed replication forks and double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. Despite the high similarity in sequence to the human ortholog, our evidence fails to support a role for Mus302 in the repair of these types of damage. Last, we observe that the N-terminal third of RFWD3 is only found in mammals, but not in other vertebrates or invertebrates. We propose that the new N-terminal sequence accounts for the acquisition of a new biological function in mammals that explains the functional differences between the human and the fly orthologs, and that Drosophila Mus302 may retain the ancestral function of the protein.","Drosophila,DNA,repair,ubiquitin,ligase","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/999.full"

However, the genetic and developmental bases of variation in insect eye size is poorly understood, which limits our understanding of how these important morphological differences evolve. To address this, we further explored natural variation in eye size within and between four species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. We found extensive variation in eye size among these species, and flies with larger eyes generally had a shorter inter-ocular distance and vice versa. We then carried out quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of intra-specific variation in eye size and inter-ocular distance in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans. This revealed that different genomic regions underlie variation in eye size and inter-ocular distance in both species, which we corroborated by introgression mapping in D. simulans. This suggests that although there is a trade-off between eye size and inter-ocular distance, variation in these two traits is likely to be caused by different genes and so can be genetically decoupled. Finally, although we detected QTL for intra-specific variation in eye size at similar positions in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we observed differences in eye fate commitment between strains of these two species. This indicates that different developmental mechanisms and therefore, most likely, different genes contribute to eye size variation in these species. Taken together with the results of previous studies, our findings suggest that the gene regulatory network that specifies eye size has evolved at multiple genetic nodes to give rise to natural variation in this trait within and among species.","Drosophila,evolution,development,eye,size,ommatidia","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1005.full"

One way to test this impact is through the application of chemical demethylation agents, such as 5-Azacytidine, which inhibit DNA methylation and lead to a partial reduction in DNA methylation across the genome. In this study, we treated 5-month-old seedlings of the tree, Quercus lobata, with foliar application of 5-Azacytidine to test whether a reduction in genome-wide methylation would cause differential gene expression and change phenotypic development. First, we demonstrate that demethylation treatment led to 3–6% absolute reductions and 6.7–43.2% relative reductions in genome-wide methylation across CG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts, with CHH showing the strongest relative reduction. Seedlings treated with 5-Azacytidine showed a substantial reduction in new growth, which was less than half that of control seedlings. We tested whether this result could be due to impact of the treatment on the soil microbiome and found minimal differences in the soil microbiome between two groups, although with limited sample size. We found no significant differences in leaf fluctuating asymmetry (i.e., deviations from bilateral symmetry), which has been found in other studies. Nonetheless, treated seedlings showed differential expression of a total of 23 genes. Overall, this study provides initial evidence that DNA methylation is involved in gene expression and phenotypic variation in seedlings and suggests that removal of DNA methylation affects plant development.","DNA,methylation,Quercus,lobata,5-Azacytidine,leaf,morphology,gene,expression","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1019.full"

To create null or null-like loss-of-function mutant zebrafish, we employed simultaneous multiple gRNA injection into single-cell stage embryos. We demonstrated that DNA composed of multiple exons, up to 78kb in length, can be deleted in the smarca2 gene locus. Additionally, two different genes (rnf185 and rnf215) were successfully mutated in F1 fish with multiple exon deletions using this multiplex gRNA injection strategy.

A hallmark of type I CRISPR-Cas systems is their ability to acquire spacers in response to both new and previously encountered invaders (naïve and primed acquisition, respectively). Our phylogenetic analyses of 43 L. pneumophila type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems and their resident genomes suggest that many of these systems have been horizontally acquired. These systems are frequently encoded on plasmids and can co-occur with nearly identical chromosomal loci. We show that two such co-occurring systems are highly protective and undergo efficient primed acquisition in the lab. Furthermore, we observe that targeting by one system’s array can prime spacer acquisition in the other. Lastly, we provide experimental and genomic evidence for a model in which primed acquisition can efficiently replenish a depleted type I CRISPR array following a mass spacer deletion event.","bacteriology,CRISPR-Cas,Legionella,microbiology","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1039.full"

Capable of displacing Aedes aegypti populations, this mosquito adapts to cooler environments which increases its geographical range and transmission potential. There are limited control strategies for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which is likely attributed to the lack of comprehensive biological studies on this emerging vector. To fill this void, here using RNAseq we characterized Aedes albopictus mRNA expression profiles at 34 distinct time points throughout development providing the first high-resolution comprehensive view of the developmental transcriptome of this worldwide human disease vector. This enabled us to identify several patterns of shared gene expression among tissues as well as sex-specific expression patterns. To illuminate the similarities and differences with Aedes aegypti, a related human disease vector, we also performed a comparative analysis between the two developmental transcriptomes, identifying life stages where the two species exhibit similar and distinct gene expression patterns. These findings provide insights into the similarities and differences between Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquito biology. In summary, the results generated from this study should form the basis for future investigations on the biology of Aedes albopictus and provide a gold mine resource for the development of transgene-based vector control strategies.","Aedes,albopictus,transcriptome,development,Zika,dengue,Aedes,aegypti,RNA-seq","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1051.full"

One approach involves finding ‘selective sweeps’ patterns, which can either be ‘hard sweeps’ formed by de novo mutation, or ‘soft sweeps’ arising from recurrent mutation or existing standing variation. Existing theory generally assumes outcrossing populations, and it is unclear how dominance affects soft sweeps. We consider how arbitrary dominance and inbreeding via self-fertilization affect hard and soft sweep signatures. With increased self-fertilization, they are maintained over longer map distances due to reduced effective recombination and faster beneficial allele fixation times. Dominance can affect sweep patterns in outcrossers if the derived variant originates from either a single novel allele, or from recurrent mutation. These models highlight the challenges in distinguishing hard and soft sweeps, and propose methods to differentiate between scenarios.","Adaptation,Dominance,Self-fertilisation,Selective,Sweeps,Population,Genetics","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1063.full"

In particular, it is difficult to reconcile the rapid divergence of intergenic regions that can make non-coding sequences almost unrecognizable even among close relatives with the unusually high levels of sequence conservation found in genic regions. It has been hypothesized that different mutation and repair mechanisms act on genic and intergenic sequences or alternatively that mutational input is relatively constant but that selection has strikingly different effects on these respective regions. To test these alternative possibilities, we analyzed mtDNA divergence within Arabidopsis thaliana, including variants from the 1001 Genomes Project and changes accrued in published mutation accumulation (MA) lines. We found that base-substitution frequencies are relatively similar for intergenic regions and synonymous sites in coding regions, whereas indel and nonsynonymous substitutions rates are greatly depressed in coding regions, supporting a conventional model in which mutation/repair mechanisms are consistent throughout the genome but differentially filtered by selection. Most types of sequence and structural changes were undetectable in 10-generation MA lines, but we found significant shifts in relative copy number across mtDNA regions for lines grown under stressed vs. benign conditions. We confirmed quantitative variation in copy number across the A. thaliana mitogenome using both whole-genome sequencing and droplet digital PCR, further undermining the classic but oversimplified model of a circular angiosperm mtDNA structure. Our results suggest that copy number variation is one of the most fluid features of angiosperm mitochondrial genomes.","copy,number,variation,mutation,accumulation,line,mutation,rate,recombination,single-nucleotide,polymorphisms","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1077.full"

Due to the complexity of the genetic control of lifespan and senescence, our understanding of the genetic basis of variation in these traits is incomplete. Here, we analyzed the pattern of genetic divergence between long-lived (O) Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for postponed reproductive senescence and unselected control (B) lines. We quantified the productivity of the O and B lines and found that reproductive senescence is maternally controlled. We therefore chose 57 candidate genes that are expressed in ovaries, 49 of which have human orthologs, and assessed the effects of RNA interference in ovaries and accessary glands on lifespan and reproduction. All but one candidate gene affected at least one life history trait in one sex or productivity week. In addition, 23 genes had antagonistic pleiotropic effects on lifespan and productivity. Identifying evolutionarily conserved genes affecting increased lifespan and delayed reproductive senescence is the first step toward understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain segregating variation at these loci in nature and may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention to delay senescence while increasing lifespan.","Laboratory,evolution,candidate,genes,RNAi","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1087.full"

Like all epithelial cells, tracheal cells use Rab GTPases to organize their internal membrane transport, resulting in the specific localization or secretion of proteins on the apical or basal membrane compartments. Some contributions of Rabs to junctional remodelling and governance of tracheal lumen contents are known, but it is reasonable to assume that they play important further roles in morphogenesis. This pertains in particular to terminal tracheal cells, specialized branch-forming cells that drastically reshape both their apical and basal membrane during the larval stages. We performed a loss-of-function screen in the tracheal system, knocking down endogenously tagged alleles of 26 Rabs by targeting the tag via RNAi. This revealed that at least 14 Rabs are required to ensure proper cell fate specification and migration of the dorsal branches, as well as their epithelial fusion with the contralateral dorsal branch. The screen implicated four Rabs in the subcellular morphogenesis of terminal cells themselves. Further tests suggested residual gene function after knockdown, leading us to discuss the limitations of this approach. We conclude that more Rabs than identified here may be important for tracheal morphogenesis, and that the tracheal system offers great opportunities for studying several Rabs that have barely been characterized so far.","nanobody,apical,extracellular,matrix,branching,morphogenesis,cell-cell,signaling,cell,fate","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1099.full"

The predictive ability was similar for single (ST-CV1) and multi-trait (MT-CV1) models to predict new lines. However, the predictive ability for agronomic traits was considerably increased when partially phenotyped lines (MT-CV2) were used. The predictive ability for grain yield using the MT-CV2 model with other agronomic traits resulted in 57% and 61% higher predictive ability than ST-CV1 and MT-CV1 models, respectively. Therefore, complex traits such as grain yield are better predicted when correlated traits are used. Similarly, a considerable increase in the predictive ability of malting quality traits was observed when correlated traits were used. The predictive ability for grain protein content using the MT-CV2 model with both agronomic and malting traits resulted in a 76% higher predictive ability than ST-CV1 and MT-CV1 models. Additionally, the higher predictive ability for new environments was obtained for all traits using the MT-CV2 model compared to the MT-CV1 model.

However, the prevalence of this phenomenon across diverse systems and its potential causes remain largely unresolved. Analysis of sex-biased genes may elucidate its possible mechanisms: for example, in systems with X/Y males a more pronounced faster-X effect in male-biased genes than in female-biased or unbiased genes may suggest fixation of recessive beneficial mutations rather than genetic drift. Further, theory predicts that the faster-X effect should be promoted by X chromosome dosage compensation. Here, we asked whether we could detect a faster-X effect in genes of the beetle Tribolium castaneum (and T. freemani orthologs), which has X/Y sex-determination and heterogametic males. Our comparison of protein sequence divergence (dN/dS) on the X chromosome vs. autosomes indicated a rarely observed absence of a faster-X effect in this organism. Further, analyses of sex-biased gene expression revealed that the X chromosome was particularly highly enriched for ovary-biased genes, which evolved slowly. In addition, an evaluation of male X chromosome dosage compensation in the gonads and in non-gonadal somatic tissues indicated a striking lack of compensation in the testis. This under-expression in testis may limit fixation of recessive beneficial X-linked mutations in genes transcribed in these male sex organs. Taken together, these beetles provide an example of the absence of a faster-X effect on protein evolution in a metazoan, that may result from two plausible factors, strong constraint on abundant X-linked ovary-biased genes and a lack of gonadal dosage compensation.","Tribolium,castaneum,faster-X,sex-biased,expression,dosage,compensation,dN/dS","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1125.full"

These animals are also constantly exposed to biotic stresses, including parasites and internal microbiomes. However, the tardigrade immune mechanisms against these biotic stresses are largely uncharacterized. Due to the contentious phylogenetic position of tardigrades, it is not intuitive whether they possess an immune system more similar to that of arthropods (e.g., Toll, Imd, and JNK pathways of the Drosophila melanogaster antimicrobial response) or to that of nematodes (e.g., the Tir-1/Nsy-1/Sek-1/Pmk-1/Atf-7 signaling cassette [called Tir-1 pathway here]) in Caenorhabditis elegans). In this study, comparative genomic analyses were conducted to mine homologs of canonical D. melanogaster and C. elegans immune pathway genes from eight tardigrades (Echiniscoides cf. sigismundi, Echiniscus testudo, Hypsibius exemplaris, Mesobiotus philippinicus, Milnesium tardigradum, Paramacrobiotus richtersi, Richtersius cf. coronifer, and Ramazzottius varieornatus) and four non-arthropod ecdysozoans (two onychophorans: Epiperipatus sp. and Opisthopatus kwazululandi; one nematomorph: Paragordius varius; and one priapulan: Priapulus caudatus) in order to provide insights into the tardigrade antimicrobial system. No homologs of the intracellular components of the Toll pathway were detected in any of the tardigrades examined. Likewise, no homologs of most of the Imd pathway genes were detected in any of the tardigrades or any of the other non-arthropod ecdysozoans. Both the JNK and Tir-1 pathways, on the other hand, were found to be conserved across ecdysozoans. Interestingly, tardigrades had no detectable homologs of NF-<U+03BA>B, the major activator of antimicrobial response gene expression. Instead, tardigrades appear to possess NF-<U+03BA>B distantly related NFAT homologs. Overall, our results show that tardigrades have a unique gene pathway repertoire that differs from that of other ecdysozoans. Our study also provides a framework for future studies on tardigrade immune responses.","tardigrade,immune,response,ecdysozoan,immune,response,biotic,stress,response,Genetics,of,Immunity","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/3/1137.full"

The results of the screen, which reveal novel expression-based lineage patterns within the brain, the imaginal disc epithelia, and the hematopoietic lymph gland, have been compiled into the G-TRACE Expression Database (GED), an online resource for use by the Drosophila research community. The impact of this discovery-based research experience on student learning gains was assessed independently and shown to be greater than that of similar programs conducted elsewhere.

Sex differences vary across strains, but many molecular studies focus on only a single strain, or on genes that show sexually dimorphic expression in many strains. How extensive variability is and whether this variability occurs among genes regulated by sex determination hierarchy terminal transcription factors is unknown. To address these questions, we examine differences in sexually dimorphic gene expression between two strains in Drosophila adult head tissues. We also examine gene expression in doublesex (dsx) mutant strains to determine which sex-differentially expressed genes are regulated by DSX, and the mode by which DSX regulates expression. We find substantial variation in sex-differential expression. The sets of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in each strain show little overlap. The prevalence of different DSX regulatory modes also varies between the two strains. Neither the patterns of DSX DNA occupancy, nor mode of DSX regulation explain why some genes show consistent sex-differential expression across strains. We find that the genes identified as regulated by DSX in this study are enriched with known sites of DSX DNA occupancy. Finally, we find that sex-differentially expressed genes and genes regulated by DSX are highly enriched on the fourth chromosome. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.","sex,determination,Drosophila,sex,hierarchy,doublesex,transcriptome,gene,expression,sex,bias,RNA-seq,Genetics,of,Sex","https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/7/1799.full"

The auxin-inducible degradation system allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation via a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate-recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID system by utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 min of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 depends on C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins. Finally, we present highly penetrant defects from NAA-mediated degradation of the FTZ-F1 nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-25, during C. elegans uterine-vulval development.

These genes were predominantly related to the biological processes of vacuolar acidification and transport, polyphosphate metabolic process, cytosolic transport, the process utilizing autophagic mechanism. A result from the measurement of intracellular zinc content showed that 64 mutants accumulated higher intracellular zinc under zinc stress than the wild-type cells. We further measured the intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels of 108 zinc-sensitive mutants treated with 3 mM ZnCl2. We showed that the intracellular ROS levels in 51 mutants were increased by high zinc stress, suggesting their possible involvement in regulating ROS homeostasis in response to high zinc. The results also revealed that excess zinc could generate oxidative damage and then activate the expression of several antioxidant defenses genes. Taken together, the data obtained indicated that excess zinc toxicity might be mainly due to the high intracellular zinc levels and ROS levels induced by zinc stress in yeast cells.

To facilitate identification of sgRNAs (1) in non-reference genomes, (2) across varying genetic backgrounds, or (3) for specific targeting of SNP-containing alleles, for example, disease relevant mutations, we developed a web tool, SNP-CRISPR (https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/snp_crispr/). SNP-CRISPR can be used to design sgRNAs based on public variant data sets or user-identified variants. In addition, the tool computes efficiency and specificity scores for sgRNA designs targeting both the variant and the reference. Moreover, SNP-CRISPR provides the option to upload multiple SNPs and target single or multiple nearby base changes simultaneously with a single sgRNA design. Given these capabilities, SNP-CRISPR has a wide range of potential research applications in model systems and for design of sgRNAs for disease-associated variant correction.","genome,editing,CRISPR,genome,variant","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/489.full"

For some neuronal proteins this information may include neurotransmitter (NT) usage and sites of NT release. However, visualizing the expression of a protein within a given neuron is often challenging because most neurons are intricately intermingled with numerous other neurons, making individual neuronal expression difficult to discern, especially since many neuronal genes are expressed at low levels. To overcome these difficulties for the Drosophila vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vAChT), attempts were made to generate conditional Drosophila vAChT alleles containing two tandem copies of epitope tags. In the course of these attempts, a strategy for multimerizing DNA repeats using the Gibson cloning reaction was serendipitously discovered. Attempts at optimization routinely yielded six or seven copies of MYC and OLLAS epitope tag coding sequences, but occasionally as many as 10 copies, thus potentially enhancing the sensitivity of protein detection up to an order of magnitude. As proof-of-principle of the method, conditionally expressible genome-edited 7XMYC-vAChT and 6XOLLAS-vAChT were developed and characterized for conditionality, synaptic vesicle specificity, and neurotransmitter specific-expression. The utility of these conditional vAChT variants was demonstrated for cholinergic neurotransmitter phenotyping and defining the polarity of cholinergic neurons, important information for understanding the functional role of neurons of interest in neural circuits and behavior. The repeat multimerization method is effective for DNA repeats of at least 56 bp and should be generally applicable to any species.","Drosophila,epitope,tag,cholinergic,multimerization,vAChT","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/495.full"

These small fish occur in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and in numerous cases the smaller freshwater populations have been established “de novo” from marine colonists. Independently evolved freshwater populations exhibit similar phenotypes that have been shown to derive largely from the same standing genetic variants. Geographic isolation prevents direct migration between the freshwater populations, strongly suggesting that these shared locally adaptive alleles are transported through the marine population. However it is still largely unknown how gene flow, recombination, and selection jointly impact the standing variation that might fuel this adaptation. Here we use individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to determine the levels of gene flow that best match observed patterns of allele sharing among habitats in stickleback. We aim to better understand how gene flow and local adaptation in large metapopulations determine the speed of adaptation and re-use of standing genetic variation. In our simulations we find that repeated adaptation uses a shared set of alleles that are maintained at low frequency by migration-selection balance in oceanic populations. This process occurs over a realistic range of intermediate levels of gene flow that match previous empirical population genomic studies in stickleback. Examining these simulations more deeply reveals how lower levels of gene flow leads to slow, independent adaptation to different habitats, whereas higher levels of gene flow leads to significant mutation load – but an increased probability of successful population genomic scans for locally adapted alleles. Surprisingly, we find that the genealogical origins of most freshwater adapted alleles can be traced back to the original generation of marine individuals that colonized the lakes, as opposed to subsequent migrants. These simulations provide deeper context for existing studies of stickleback evolutionary genomics, and guidance for future empirical studies in this model. More broadly, our results support existing theory of local adaptation but extend it by more completely documenting the genealogical history of adaptive alleles in a metapopulation.","local,adaptation,threespine,stickleback,genomic,simulation","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/505.full"

Homebox D11 (Hoxd11) is one of the important genes required for limb development in mammals. Mutations in Hoxd11 can lead to defects in particular bones of limbs, including carpus and tarsus. To test whether evolutionary changes in Hoxd11 underlie the loss of these bones in Cetruminantia, we sequenced and analyzed Hoxd11 coding sequences and compared them with other 5' HoxA and HoxD genes in a taxonomic coverage of Cetacea, Ruminantia and other mammalian relatives. Statistical tests on the Hoxd11 sequences found an accelerated evolution in the common ancestor of cetaceans and ruminants, which coincided with the reduction of carpal and tarsal bones in this clade. Five amino acid substitutions (G222S, G227A, G229S, A240T and G261V) and one amino acid deletion (G254Del) occurred in this lineage. In contrast, other 5' HoxA and HoxD genes do not show this same evolutionary pattern, but instead display a highly conserved pattern of evolution in this lineage. Accelerated evolution of Hoxd11, but not other 5' HoxA and HoxD genes, is probably related to the reduction of the carpal and tarsal bones in Cetruminantia. Moreover, we found two amino acid substitutions (G110S and D223N) in Hoxd11 that are unique to the lineage of Cetacea, which coincided with hindlimb loss in the common ancestor of cetaceans.

During meiosis, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) made in prophase I are normally repaired as gene conversions or crossovers. DSBs can also be made by other mechanisms, such as the movement of transposable elements (TEs), which must also be resolved. Incorrect repair of these DNA lesions can lead to mutations, copy-number changes, translocations, and/or aneuploid gametes. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in most organisms, meiotic DSB repair occurs in the presence of a rapidly evolving multiprotein structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC). Here, whole-genome sequencing is used to investigate the fate of meiotic DSBs in D. melanogaster mutant females lacking functional SC, to assay for de novo CNV formation, and to examine the role of the SC in transposable element movement in flies. The data indicate that, in the absence of SC, copy-number variation still occurs and meiotic DSB repair by gene conversion occurs infrequently. Remarkably, an 856-kilobase de novo CNV was observed in two unrelated individuals of different genetic backgrounds and was identical to a CNV recovered in a previous wild-type study, suggesting that recurrent formation of large CNVs occurs in Drosophila. In addition, the rate of novel TE insertion was markedly higher than wild type in one of two SC mutants tested, suggesting that SC proteins may contribute to the regulation of TE movement and insertion in the genome. Overall, this study provides novel insight into the role that the SC plays in genome stability and provides clues as to why the sequence, but not structure, of SC proteins is rapidly evolving.","meiosis,whole-genome,sequencing,crossing,over,noncrossover,gene,conversion,c(3)G,corolla,synaptonemal,complex,transposable,element,copy-number,variation,sister,chromatid,exchange","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/525.full"

These procedures are however a welfare concern. Selective breeding for polledness – absence of horns – has been effective in some cattle breeds but not in others (Bos indicus genotypes) due in part to the complex genetics of horn phenotype. To address this problem different approaches to genetic testing which provide accurate early-in-life prediction of horn phenotype have been evaluated, initially using microsatellites (MSAT) and more recently single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A direct gene test is not effective given the genetic heterogeneity and large-sized sequence variants associated with polledness in different breeds. The current study investigated 39,943 animals of multiple breeds to assess the accuracy of available poll testing assays. While the standard SNP-based test was an improvement on the earlier MSAT haplotyping method, 1999 (9.69%) out of 20,636 animals tested with this SNP-based assay did not predict a genotype, most commonly associated with the Indicus-influenced breeds. The current study has developed an optimized poll gene test that resolved the vast majority of these 1999 unresolved animals, while the predicted genotypes of those previously resolved remained unchanged. Hence the optimized poll test successfully predicted a genotype in 99.96% of samples assessed. We demonstrated that a robust set of 5 SNPs can effectively determine PC and PF alleles and eliminate the ambiguous and undetermined results of poll gene testing previously identified as an issue in cattle.","Poll,gene,bovine,dehorning,genetic,testing,animal,welfare,Genomic,Prediction,GenPred,Shared,Data,Resources","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/539.full"

Pairwise epistatic interactions were observed, and the dehiscent Pdh1 overcomes resistance conferred by NST1A or SHAT1-5 locus. Further candidate gene association analysis identified a nonsense mutation in NST1A associated with pod dehiscence. Geographic analysis showed that in Northeast China (NEC), indehiscence at both Pdh1 and NST1A were required in cultivated soybean, while indehiscent Pdh1 alone is capable of preventing shattering in Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) valleys. Indehiscent Pdh1 allele was only identified in wild soybean (Glycine soja L.) accession from HHH valleys suggesting that it may have originated in this region. No specific indehiscence was required in Southern China. Geo-climatic investigation revealed strong correlation between relative humidity and frequency of indehiscent Pdh1 across China. This study demonstrates that epistatic interaction between Pdh1 and NST1A fulfills a pivotal role in determining the level of resistance against pod dehiscence, and humidity shapes the distribution of indehiscent alleles.

While alternative splicing has been shown to regulate inflammatory responses in macrophages in vitro, it has not been investigated on a genome-wide scale in vivo. Here we used RNAseq to investigate alternative pre-mRNA splicing in alveolar macrophages isolated from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice during the peak of inflammation and during its resolution. We found that lung inflammation induced substantial alternative pre-mRNA splicing in alveolar macrophages. The number of changes in isoform usage was greatest at the peak of inflammation and involved multiple classes of alternative pre-mRNA splicing events. Comparative pathway analysis of inflammation-induced changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and differential gene expression revealed overlap of pathways enriched for immune responses such as chemokine signaling and cellular metabolism. Moreover, alternative pre-mRNA splicing of genes in metabolic pathways differed in tissue resident vs. recruited (blood monocyte-derived) alveolar macrophages and corresponded to changes in core metabolism, including a switch to Warburg-like metabolism in recruited macrophages with increased glycolysis and decreased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.","alternative,pre-mRNA,splicing,alveolar,macrophage,lipopolysaccharide,glycolysis,tricarboxylic,acid,cycle","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/555.full"

For this, we developed an R package to simulate genotyping data under such scenarios. The tested inference methods performed similarly well as far as representatives of source populations were available. As expected, the higher the level of differentiation between ancestral source populations and the lower the number of generations since admixture, the more accurate were the results. Interestingly, the accuracy of the methods was only marginally affected by i) the number of ancestries (up to six tested); ii) the sample design (i.e., unbalanced representation of source populations); and iii) the reproduction mode (e.g., selfing, vegetative propagation). If a source population was not represented in the data set, no bias was observed in inference accuracy for regions originating from represented sources and regions from the missing source were assigned differently depending on the methods. Overall, the selected ancestry inference methods may be used for crop plant analysis if all ancestral sources are known.","local,ancestry,inference,crops,admixture,simulation,analysis","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/569.full"

However, it requires genome-wide genetic marker data on large populations, which can be prohibitively expensive. Genotype imputation is a cost-effective method for obtaining high-density genotypes, but its value in aquaculture breeding programs which are characterized by large full-sibling families has yet to be fully assessed. The aim of this study was to optimize the use of low-density genotypes and evaluate genotype imputation strategies for cost-effective genomic prediction. Phenotypes and genotypes (78,362 SNPs) were obtained for 610 individuals from a Scottish Atlantic salmon breeding program population (Landcatch, UK) challenged with sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. The genomic prediction accuracy of genomic selection was calculated using GBLUP approaches and compared across SNP panels of varying densities and composition, with and without imputation. Imputation was tested when parents were genotyped for the optimal SNP panel, and offspring were genotyped for a range of lower density imputation panels. Reducing SNP density had little impact on prediction accuracy until 5,000 SNPs, below which the accuracy dropped. Imputation accuracy increased with increasing imputation panel density. Genomic prediction accuracy when offspring were genotyped for just 200 SNPs, and parents for 5,000 SNPs, was 0.53. This accuracy was similar to the full high density and optimal density dataset, and markedly higher than using 200 SNPs without imputation. These results suggest that imputation from very low to medium density can be a cost-effective tool for genomic selection in Atlantic salmon breeding programs.","Salmon,breeding,genotype,imputation,aquaculture,sea,lice,resistance,genomic,prediction,Genomic,Prediction,GenPred,Shared,Data,Resources","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/581.full"

In animals, the host immune system is at the center of this relationship. Failed host immune system-microbial interactions can result in a persistent inflammatory response in which the immune system indiscriminately attacks resident microbes, and at times the host cells themselves, leading to diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease, and Psoriasis. Host genetic variation has been linked to both microbiome diversity and to severity of such inflammatory disease states in humans. However, the microbiome and inflammatory states manifest as quantitative traits, which encompass many genes interacting with one another and the environment. The mechanistic relationships among all of these interacting components are still not clear. Developing natural genetic models of host-microbe interactions is therefore fundamental to understanding the complex genetics of these and other diseases. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish are a tractable model for attacking this problem because of abundant population-level genetic and phenotypic variation in the gut inflammatory response. Previous work in our laboratory identified genetically divergent stickleback populations exhibiting differences in intestinal neutrophil activity. We took advantage of this diversity to genetically map variation in an emblematic element of gut inflammation - intestinal neutrophil recruitment - using an F2-intercross mapping framework. We identified two regions of the genome associated with increased intestinal inflammation containing several promising candidate genes. Within these regions we found candidates in the Coagulation/Complement System, NFkB and MAPK pathways along with several genes associated with intestinal diseases and neurological diseases commonly accompanying intestinal inflammation as a secondary symptom. These findings highlight the utility of using naturally genetically diverse ‘evolutionary mutant models’ such as threespine stickleback to better understand interactions among host genetic diversity and microbiome variation in health and disease states.","QTL,mapping,neutrophil,inflammation,immunity,threespine,stickleback,Genetics,of,Immunity","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/613.full"

Our previous study revealed that the Solanum andigena genotype 03112-233 is resistant to P. infestans isolate 90128, but susceptible to the super race isolate, CN152. In this study, we confirmed by diagnostic resistance gene enrichment sequencing (dRenSeq) that the resistance of 03112-233 toward 90128 is most likely based on a distinct new R gene(s). To gain an insight into the mechanism that governs resistance or susceptibility in 03112-223, comparative transcriptomic profiling analysis based on RNAseq was initiated. Changes in transcription at two time points (24 h and 72 h) after inoculation with isolates 90128 or CN152 were analyzed. A total of 8,881 and 7,209 genes were differentially expressed in response to 90128 and CN152, respectively, and 1,083 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were common to both time points and isolates. A substantial number of genes were differentially expressed in an isolate-specific manner with 3,837 genes showing induction or suppression following infection with 90128 and 2,165 genes induced or suppressed after colonization by CN152. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that isolates with different virulence profiles can induce different defense responses at different time points. Further analysis revealed that the compatible interaction caused higher induction of susceptibility genes such as SWEET compared with the incompatible interaction. The salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid mediated signaling pathways were involved in the response against both isolates, while ethylene and brassinosteroids mediated defense pathways were suppressed. Our results provide a valuable resource for understanding the interactions between P. infestans and potato.","Potato,late,blight,Phytophthora,infestans,RNAseq,dRenSeq","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/623.full"

Here, we report on the adaptation of the SapTrap method for the efficient and modular assembly of a promoter, 3'UTR and either 2 or 3 gene fragments in a MosSCI targeting vector in a single reaction. We generated a toolkit that includes several fluorescent tags, components of the ePDZ/LOV optogenetic system and regulatory elements that control gene expression in the C. elegans germline. As a proof of principle, we generated a collection of strains that fluorescently label the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in the hermaphrodite germline and that enable the light-stimulated recruitment of mitochondria to centrosomes in the one-cell worm embryo. The method described here offers a flexible and efficient method for assembly of custom MosSCI targeting vectors.","MosSCI,C.,elegans,mitochondria,endoplasmic,reticulum,SapTrap","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/635.full"

Here we perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and accompanying phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) to validate phenotype-genotype associations of BMI, and to a greater extent, severe Class 2 obesity, using comprehensive diagnostic and clinical data from the EHR database of our cohort. Three GWASs of 500,000 variants on the Illumina platform of 6,645 Healthy Nevada participants identified several published and novel variants that affect BMI and obesity. Each GWAS was followed with two independent PheWASs to examine associations between extensive phenotypes (incidence of diagnoses, condition, or disease), significant SNPs, BMI, and incidence of extreme obesity. The first GWAS examines associations with BMI in a cohort with no type 2 diabetics, focusing exclusively on BMI. The second GWAS examines associations with BMI in a cohort that includes type 2 diabetics. In the second GWAS, type 2 diabetes is a comorbidity, and thus becomes a covariate in the statistical model. The intersection of significant variants of these two studies is surprising. The third GWAS is a case vs. control study, with cases defined as extremely obese (Class 2 or 3 obesity), and controls defined as participants with BMI between 18.5 and 25. This last GWAS identifies strong associations with extreme obesity, including established variants in the FTO and NEGR1 genes, as well as loci not yet linked to obesity. The PheWASs validate published associations between BMI and extreme obesity and incidence of specific diagnoses and conditions, yet also highlight novel links. This study emphasizes the importance of our extensive longitudinal EHR database to validate known associations and identify putative novel links with BMI and obesity.","GWAS,PheWAS,BMI,Obesity","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/645.full"

A deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of yield components may enable better ways to tackle the breeding challenges. Key yield components include the total number of pods, nodes and the ratio pods per node. We evaluated the SoyNAM population, containing approximately 5600 lines from 40 biparental families that share a common parent, in 6 environments distributed across 3 years. The study indicates that the yield components under evaluation have low heritability, a reasonable amount of epistatic control, and partially oligogenic architecture: 18 quantitative trait loci were identified across the three yield components using multi-approach signal detection. Genetic correlation between yield and yield components was highly variable from family-to-family, ranging from -0.2 to 0.5. The genotype-by-environment correlation of yield components ranged from -0.1 to 0.4 within families. The number of pods can be utilized for indirect selection of yield. The selection of soybean for enhanced yield components can be successfully performed via genomic prediction, but the challenging data collections necessary to recalibrate models over time makes the introgression of QTL a potentially more feasible breeding strategy. The genomic prediction of yield components was relatively accurate across families, but less accurate predictions were obtained from within family predictions and predicting families not observed included in the calibration set.","soybean,genomic,prediction,GWAS,GxE,yield,yield,components,heritability,SoyNAM","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/665.full"

However, such methods have the potential to be confounded by features of demographic history, such as population size and migration, which are considerably varied across natural populations. In this study, we use forward-simulations to investigate and illustrate how several measures of genetic differentiation commonly used in outlier scans (FST, DXY and <U+0394>p) are influenced by demographic variation across multiple sampling generations. In a factorial design with 16 treatments, we manipulate the presence/absence of founding bottlenecks (N of founding individuals), prolonged bottlenecks (proportional size of diverging population) and migration rate between two populations with ancestral and diverged phenotypic optima. Our results illustrate known constraints of individual measures associated with reduced population size and a lack of migration; but notably we demonstrate how relationships between measures are similarly dependent on these features of demography. We find that false-positive signals of convergent evolution (the same simulated outliers detected in independent treatments) are attainable as a product of similar population size and migration treatments (particularly for DXY), and that outliers across different measures (for e.g., FST and DXY) can occur with little influence of selection. Taken together, we show how underappreciated, yet quantifiable measures of demographic history can influence commonly employed methods for detecting selection.","Outlier,scans,demographic,history,FST,DXY,false-positives,convergence","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/677.full"

Genetic improvement for nutritive traits in perennial ryegrass has been limited, as they are typically expensive and time-consuming to measure through conventional methods. Genomic selection is appropriate for such complex and expensive traits, enabling cost-effective prediction of breeding values using genome-wide markers. The aims of the present study were to assess the potential of genomic selection for a range of nutritive traits in a multi-population training set, and to quantify contributions of family, location and family-by-location variance components to trait variation and heritability for nutritive traits. The training set consisted of a total of 517 half-sibling (half-sib) families, from five advanced breeding populations, evaluated in two distinct New Zealand grazing environments. Autumn-harvested samples were analyzed for 18 nutritive traits and maternal parents of the half-sib families were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing. Significant (P < 0.05) family variance was detected for all nutritive traits and genomic heritability (h2g) was moderate to high (0.20 to 0.74). Family-by-location interactions were significant and particularly large for water soluble carbohydrate (WSC), crude fat, phosphorus (P) and crude protein. GBLUP, KGD-GBLUP and BayesCp genomic prediction models displayed similar predictive ability, estimated by 10-fold cross validation, for all nutritive traits with values ranging from r = 0.16 to 0.45 using phenotypes from across two locations. High predictive ability was observed for the mineral traits sulfur (0.44), sodium (0.45) and magnesium (0.45) and the lowest values were observed for P (0.16), digestibility (0.22) and high molecular weight WSC (0.23). Predictive ability estimates for most nutritive traits were retained when marker number was reduced from one million to as few as 50,000. The moderate to high predictive abilities observed suggests implementation of genomic selection is feasible for most of the nutritive traits examined.","genomic,selection,heritability,nutritive,traits,perennial,ryegrass,water,soluble,carbohydrates","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/695.full"

Since a previous study in 2007, GH13_1 amylases were considered ancestral to the Unikonts, including animals, except Bilateria, such that it was thought to have been lost in the ancestor of this clade. The only alpha-amylases known to be present in Bilateria so far belong to the GH13_15 and 24 subfamilies (commonly called bilaterian alpha-amylases) and were likely acquired by horizontal transfer from a proteobacterium. The taxonomic scope of Eukaryota genomes in databases has been greatly increased ever since 2007. We have surveyed GH13_1 sequences in recent data from ca. 1600 bilaterian species, 60 non-bilaterian animals and also in unicellular eukaryotes. As expected, we found a number of those sequences in non-bilaterians: Anthozoa (Cnidaria) and in sponges, confirming the previous observations, but none in jellyfishes and in Ctenophora. Our main and unexpected finding is that such fungal (also called Dictyo-type) amylases were also consistently retrieved in several bilaterian phyla: hemichordates (deuterostomes), brachiopods and related phyla, some molluscs and some annelids (protostomes). We discuss evolutionary hypotheses possibly explaining the scattered distribution of GH13_1 across bilaterians, namely, the retention of the ancestral gene in those phyla only and/or horizontal transfers from non-bilaterian donors.","alpha-amylase,gene,loss,horizontal,gene,transfer,hemichordates,brachiopods,phoronids,bryozoans,molluscs,annelids,Bilateria,glycosyl,hydrolase,introns","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/709.full"

This method combines information on sequence similarity and synteny to identify contaminant and putative horizontally-transferred sequences in any genome assembly, provided that an adequate reference database is available. We uncovered considerable heterogeneity in quality among arthropod assemblies, some being devoid of contaminant sequences, whereas others included hundreds of contaminant genes. Contaminants far outnumbered horizontally-transferred genes and were a major confounder of their detection, quantification and analysis.

Although many genetic and genomic resources have been generated for cotton, the genetic underpinnings of the transition from wild to domesticated cotton remain poorly known. Here we generated an intraspecific QTL mapping population specifically targeting domesticated cotton phenotypes. We used 466 F2 individuals derived from an intraspecific cross between the wild Gossypium hirsutum var. yucatanense (TX2094) and the elite cultivar G. hirsutum cv. Acala Maxxa, in two environments, to identify 120 QTL associated with phenotypic changes under domestication. While the number of QTL recovered in each subpopulation was similar, only 22 QTL were considered coincident (i.e., shared) between the two locations, eight of which shared peak markers. Although approximately half of QTL were located in the A-subgenome, many key fiber QTL were detected in the D-subgenome, which was derived from a species with unspinnable fiber. We found that many QTL are environment-specific, with few shared between the two environments, indicating that QTL associated with G. hirsutum domestication are genomically clustered but environmentally labile. Possible candidate genes were recovered and are discussed in the context of the phenotype. We conclude that the evolutionary forces that shape intraspecific divergence and domestication in cotton are complex, and that phenotypic transformations likely involved multiple interacting and environmentally responsive factors.","QTL,domestication,Gossypium,hirsutum,cotton","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/731.full"

It is known that vertebrates and Caenorhabditis genomes harbor two uggt gene copies that exhibit differences in their properties.Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on 195 UGGT and UGGT-like protein sequences of an ample spectrum of eukaryotic species showed that uggt genes went through independent duplications in Caenorhabditis and vertebrates. In both lineages, the catalytic domain of the duplicated genes was subjected to a strong purifying selective pressure, while the recognition domain was subjected to episodic positive diversifying selection. Selective relaxation in the recognition domain was more pronounced in Caenorhabditis uggt-b than in vertebrates uggt-2. Structural bioinformatics analysis revealed that Caenorhabditis UGGT-b protein lacks essential sequences proposed to be involved in the recognition of unfolded proteins. When we assayed glucosyltrasferase activity of a chimeric protein composed by Caenorhabditis uggt-b recognition domain fused to S. pombe catalytic domain expressed in yeast, no activity was detected.The present results support the conservation of the UGGT activity in the catalytic domain and a putative divergent function of the recognition domain for the UGGT2 protein in vertebrates, which would have gone through a specialization process. In Caenorhabditis, uggt-b evolved under different constraints compared to uggt-a which, by means of a putative neofunctionalization process, resulted in a non-redundant paralog. The non-canonical function of uggt-b in the worm lineage highlights the need to take precautions before generalizing gene functions in model organisms.","UDP-,glucose:,glycoprotein,glucosyltransferase,Caenorhabditis,elegans,Vertebrates,Purifying,selection,Positive,selection,Neofunctionalization","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/755.full"

We evaluated five genomic prediction models: Bayesian network (BN), Pleiotropic Bayesian network (PBN), Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), multi-trait GBLUP (MTr-GBLUP), and multi-time GBLUP (MTi-GBLUP) models. In fivefold cross-validation, prediction accuracies ranged from 0.46 (PBN) to 0.49 (MTr-GBLUP) for DBY and from 0.47 (DBN, DAP120) to 0.75 (MTi-GBLUP, DAP60) for PH. Forward-chaining cross-validation further improved prediction accuracies of the DBN, MTi-GBLUP and MTr-GBLUP models for PH (training slice: 30-45 DAP) by 36.4–52.4% relative to the BN and PBN models. Coincidence indices (target: biomass, secondary: PH) and a coincidence index based on lines (PH time series) showed that the ranking of lines by PH changed minimally after 45 DAP. These results suggest a two-level indirect selection method for PH at harvest (first-level target trait) and DBY (second-level target trait) could be conducted earlier in the season based on ranking of lines by PH at 45 DAP (secondary trait). With the advance of high-throughput phenotyping technologies, our proposed two-level indirect selection framework could be valuable for enhancing genetic gain per unit of time when selecting on developmental traits.","Bayesian,networks,biomass,sorghum,genomic,prediction,indirect,selection,probabilistic,programming,Genomic,Prediction,GenPred,Shared,Data,Resources","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/769.full"

In addition, we found that with epistasis,  decreases with an increase of the number of interactions per locus. For both dominance and epistasis, we found that, when non-additive effects became extremely large,  had a lower bound that was determined by the type of inter-allelic interaction, and the difference in allele frequencies between populations. Given that dominance variance is usually small, our results show that it is unlikely that true  values lower than 0.80 are due to dominance effects alone.

The vey1 allele of Mo17 inbred line reduces chlorophyll content in the mutants leading to reduced photosynthetic output. Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 reached reproductive maturity four days later than wild-type siblings. Enhancement of Oy1-N1989 by the Mo17 allele at the vey1 QTL delayed maturity further, resulting in detection of a flowering time QTL in two bi-parental mapping populations crossed to Oy1-N1989. The near isogenic lines of B73 harboring the vey1 allele from Mo17 delayed flowering of Oy1-N1989 mutants by twelve days. Just as previously observed for chlorophyll content, vey1 had no effect on reproductive maturity in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 allele. Loss of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Oy1-N1989 mutants and enhancement by vey1 reduced CO2 assimilation. We attempted to separate the effects of photosynthesis on the induction of flowering from a possible impact of chlorophyll metabolites and retrograde signaling by manually reducing leaf area. Removal of leaves, independent of the Oy1-N1989 mutant, delayed flowering but surprisingly reduced chlorophyll contents of emerging leaves. Thus, defoliation did not completely separate the identity of the signal(s) that regulates flowering time from changes in chlorophyll content in the foliage. These findings illustrate the necessity to explore the linkage between metabolism and the mechanisms that connect it to flowering time regulation.","flowering,time,photosynthesis,epistasis,setaria,sorghum","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/797.full"

Animals, the monophyletic clade known as Metazoa, evolved wildly divergent multicellular life strategies featuring ciliated sensory epithelia. In many lineages epithelial sensoria became coupled to increasingly complex nervous systems. Currently, different phylogenetic analyses of single-copy genes support mutually-exclusive possibilities that either Porifera or Ctenophora is sister to all other animals. Resolving this dilemma would advance the ecological and evolutionary understanding of the first animals and the evolution of nervous systems. Here we describe a comparative phylogenetic approach based on gene duplications. We computationally identify and analyze gene families with early metazoan duplications using an approach that mitigates apparent gene loss resulting from the miscalling of paralogs. In the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family of mechano-transducing channels, we find ancient duplications that define separate clades for Eumetazoa (Placozoa + Cnidaria + Bilateria) vs. Ctenophora, and one duplication that is shared only by Eumetazoa and Porifera. In the Max-like protein X (MLX and MLXIP) family of bHLH-ZIP regulators of metabolism, we find that all major lineages from Eumetazoa and Porifera (sponges) share a duplicated gene pair that is sister to the single-copy gene maintained in Ctenophora. These results suggest a new avenue for deducing deep phylogeny by choosing rather than avoiding ancient gene paralogies.","animal,evolution,gene,duplication,Max-like,X,(MLX),MLX,interacting,protein,(MLXIP),transmembrane,channel-like,proteins,(TMCs)","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/811.full"

Given that host encoded genes have been identified that are important for pathogen transmission, targeting these genes using guide RNAs as cargo genes linked to drives may provide a robust method to prevent disease transmission. However, effectiveness of the inclusion of additional guide RNAs that target separate genes has not been thoroughly explored. To test this approach, we generated a split-HGD in Drosophila melanogaster that encoded a drive linked effector consisting of a second gRNA engineered to target a separate host-encoded gene, which we term a gRNA-mediated effector (GME). This design enabled us to assess homing and knockout efficiencies of two target genes simultaneously, and also explore the timing and tissue specificity of Cas9 expression on cleavage/homing rates. We demonstrate that inclusion of a GME can result in high efficiency of disruption of both genes during super-Mendelian propagation of split-HGD. Furthermore, both genes were knocked out one generation earlier than expected indicating the robust somatic expression of Cas9 driven by Drosophila germline-limited promoters. We also assess the efficiency of ‘shadow drive’ generated by maternally deposited Cas9 protein and accumulation of drive-induced resistance alleles along multiple generations, and discuss design principles of HGD that could mitigate the accumulation of resistance alleles while incorporating a GME.","CRISPR,Cas9,Homing,split-HGD,Drosophila,melanogaster,resistance,allele","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/2/827.full"

On crossing maize-Tripsacum (2n = 4x = 56, MMTT) with Z. perennis, 37 progenies with varying chromosome numbers (36-74) were obtained, and a special one (i.e., tripsazea) possessing 2n = 74 chromosomes was generated. Tripsazea is perennial and expresses phenotypic characteristics affected by its progenitor parent. Flow cytometry analysis of tripsazea and its parents showed that tripsazea underwent DNA sequence elimination during allohexaploidization.

Tripsazea is male sterile and partly female fertile. In comparison with previously synthesized trihybrids containing maize, Tripsacum and teosinte, tripsazea has a higher chromosome number, higher seed setting rate, and vegetative propagation ability of stand and stem.

To find entry points for small molecules that might extend healthy longevity in humans, we screened ~100,000 small molecules in a human primary-fibroblast cell line and identified a set that increased oxidative-stress resistance. Some of the hits fell into structurally related chemical groups, suggesting that they may act on common targets. Two small molecules increased C. elegans’ stress resistance, and at least 9 extended their lifespan by ~10–50%. We further evaluated a chalcone that produced relatively large effects on lifespan and were able to implicate the activity of two, stress-response regulators, NRF2/skn-1 and SESN/sesn-1, in its mechanism of action. Our findings suggest that screening for increased stress resistance in human cells can enrich for compounds with promising pro-longevity effects.

At 26°, DREAM complex mutants show increased misexpression of germline genes in somatic cells and High Temperature Arrest (HTA) of worms at the first larval stage. To identify transcription factors required for the ectopic expression of germline genes in DREAM complex mutants, we conducted an RNA interference screen against 123 transcription factors capable of binding DREAM target promoter loci for suppression of the HTA phenotype in lin-54 mutants. We found that knock-down of 15 embryonically expressed transcription factors suppress the HTA phenotype in lin-54 mutants. Five of the transcription factors found in the initial screen have associations with Wnt signaling pathways. In a subsequent RNAi suppression screen of Wnt signaling factors we found that knock-down of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway factors vang-1, prkl-1 and fmi-1 in a lin-54 mutant background resulted in strong suppression of the HTA phenotype. Animals mutant for both lin-54 and vang-1 showed almost complete suppression of the HTA phenotype, pgl-1 misexpression, and fertility defects associated with lin-54 single mutants at 26°.

Sex differences vary across strains, but many molecular studies focus on only a single strain, or on genes that show sexually dimorphic expression in many strains. How extensive variability is and whether this variability occurs among genes regulated by sex determination hierarchy terminal transcription factors is unknown. To address these questions, we examine differences in sexually dimorphic gene expression between two strains in Drosophila adult head tissues. We also examine gene expression in doublesex (dsx) mutant strains to determine which sex-differentially expressed genes are regulated by DSX, and the mode by which DSX regulates expression. We find substantial variation in sex-differential expression. The sets of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in each strain show little overlap. The prevalence of different DSX regulatory modes also varies between the two strains. Neither the patterns of DSX DNA occupancy, nor mode of DSX regulation explain why some genes show consistent sex-differential expression across strains. We find that the genes identified as regulated by DSX in this study are enriched with known sites of DSX DNA occupancy. Finally, we find that sex-differentially expressed genes and genes regulated by DSX are highly enriched on the fourth chromosome. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.","sex,determination,Drosophila,sex,hierarchy,doublesex,transcriptome,gene,expression,sex,bias,RNA-seq,Genetics,of,Sex","https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/7/1799.full"

The auxin-inducible degradation system allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation via a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate-recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID system by utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 min of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 depends on C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins. Finally, we present highly penetrant defects from NAA-mediated degradation of the FTZ-F1 nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-25, during C. elegans uterine-vulval development.

During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.","Extracellular,vesicle,whole,genome,sequencing,Leptopilina,heterotoma,endoparasitoid,wasp,Drosophila,VLP,host-parasite,organelle,immune,suppression","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/1.full"

In this study, we have sequenced the genomes of two clinical M. abscessus strains having rough and smooth morphology, using the single molecule real-time and Illumina HiSeq sequencing technology. In addition, we reported the first comparative methylome profiles of a rough and a smooth M. abscessus clinical strains. The number of N4-methylcytosine (4mC) and N6-methyladenine (6mA) modified bases obtained from smooth phenotype were two-fold and 1.6 fold respectively higher than that of rough phenotype. We have also identified 4 distinct novel motifs in two clinical strains and genes encoding antibiotic-modifying/targeting enzymes and genes associated with intracellular survivability having different methylation patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first report about genome-wide methylation profiles of M. abscessus strains and identification of a natural linear plasmid (15 kb) in this critical pathogen harboring methylated bases. The pan-genome analysis of 25 M. abscessus strains including two clinical strains revealed an open pan genome comprises of 7596 gene clusters. Likewise, structural variation analysis revealed that the genome of rough phenotype strain contains more insertions and deletions than the smooth phenotype and that of the reference strain. A total of 391 single nucleotide variations responsible for the non-synonymous mutations were detected in clinical strains compared to the reference genome. The comparative genomic analysis elucidates the genome plasticity in this emerging pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of genome-wide methylation profiles of M. abscessus clinical strains may provide insight into the significant role of DNA methylation in pathogenicity and drug resistance in this opportunistic pathogen.","Mycobacterium,abscessus,SMRT,sequencing,comparative,genomics,whole,genome,sequencing,methylation,single,nucleotide,variation","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/13.full"

Hypocrellin, its main active ingredient, is widely used in several fields, such as medicine, agriculture, and food industry. In this study, to clarify the genomic components, taxonomic status, pathogenic genes, secondary metabolite synthesis pathways, and regulatory mechanisms of S. bambusicola, whole-genome sequencing, assembly, and functional annotation were performed using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. It was observed that S. bambusicola has 33 Mb genome size, 48.89% GC content, 333 scaffolds, 2590 contigs, 10,703 genes, 82 tRNAs, and 21 rRNAs. The total length of the repeat sequence is 2,151,640 bp. The annotation of 5945 proteins was obtained from InterProScan hits based on the Gene Ontology database. Phylogenetic analysis showed that S. bambusicola belongs to Shiraiaceae, a new family of Pleosporales. It was speculated that there are more than two species or genus in Shiraiaceae. According to the annotation, 777 secreted proteins were associated with virulence or detoxification, including 777 predicted by the PHI database, 776 by the CAZY and Fungal CytochromeP450 database, and 441 by the Proteases database. The 252 genes associated with the secondary metabolism of S. bambusicola were screened and enriched into 28 pathways, among which the terpenoids, staurosporine, aflatoxin, and folate synthesis pathways have not been reported in S. bambusicola. The T1PKS was the main gene cluster among the 28 secondary metabolite synthesis gene clusters in S. bambusicola. The analysis of the T3PKS gene cluster related to the synthesis of hypocrellin showed that there was some similarity between S. bambusicola and 10 other species of fungi; however, the similarity was very low wherein the highest similarity was 17%. The genomic information of S. bambusicola obtained in this study was valuable to understand its genetic function and pathogenicity. The genomic information revealed that several enzyme genes and secreted proteins might be related to their host interactions and pathogenicity. The annotation and analysis of its secondary metabolite synthesis genes and gene clusters will be an important reference for future studies on the biosynthesis and regulation mechanism of the secondary metabolites, contributing to the discovery of new metabolites and accelerating drug development and application.","Genomic,sequencing,Functional,annotation,Phylogenetic,analysis,Pathogenic,gene,Secondary,metabolism","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/23.full"

Although the formation of motor circuits is known to be under developmental control of transcriptional mechanisms that define the fates and connectivity of the many neurons, glia and muscle constituents of these circuits, relatively little is known about the role of post-transcriptional regulation of locomotor behavior. MicroRNAs have emerged as a potentially rich source of modulators for neural development and function. In order to define the microRNAs required for normal locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster, we utilized a set of transgenic Gal4-dependent competitive inhibitors (microRNA sponges, or miR-SPs) to functionally assess ca. 140 high-confidence Drosophila microRNAs using automated quantitative movement tracking systems followed by multiparametric analysis. Using ubiquitous expression of miR-SP constructs, we identified a large number of microRNAs that modulate aspects of normal baseline adult locomotion. Addition of temperature-dependent Gal80 to identify microRNAs that act during adulthood revealed that the majority of these microRNAs play developmental roles. Comparison of ubiquitous and neural-specific miR-SP expression suggests that most of these microRNAs function within the nervous system. Parallel analyses of spontaneous locomotion in adults and in larvae also reveal that very few of the microRNAs required in the adult overlap with those that control the behavior of larval motor circuits. These screens suggest that a rich regulatory landscape underlies the formation and function of motor circuits and that many of these mechanisms are stage and/or parameter-specific.","microRNA,motor,behavior,Drosophila,melanogaster","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/43.full"

To identify additional functions for phosphoinositides in growth control, we performed a genetic screen to identify proteins which when depleted result in altered tissue growth. By using RNA-interference mediated depletion coupled with mosaic analysis in developing eyes, we identified and classified additional candidates in the developing Drosophila melanogaster eye that regulate growth either cell autonomously or via cell-cell interactions. We report three genes: Pi3K68D, Vps34 and fwd that are important for growth regulation and suggest that these are likely to act via cell-cell interactions in the developing eye.

Peroxisome loss or dysfunction leads to multi-system diseases in humans that strongly affect the nervous system. In order to identify previously unidentified genes and mechanisms that impact peroxisomes, we conducted a genetic screen on a collection of lethal mutations on the X chromosome in Drosophila. Using the number, size and morphology of GFP tagged peroxisomes as a readout, we screened for mutations that altered peroxisomes based on clonal analysis and confocal microscopy. From this screen, we identified eighteen genes that cause increases in peroxisome number or altered morphology when mutated. We examined the human homologs of these genes and found that they are involved in a diverse array of cellular processes. Interestingly, the human homologs from the X-chromosome collection are under selective constraint in human populations and are good candidate genes particularly for dominant genetic disease. This in vivo screening approach for peroxisome defects allows identification of novel genes that impact peroxisomes in vivo in a multicellular organism and is a valuable platform to discover genes potentially involved in dominant disease that could affect peroxisomes.","Drosophila,peroxisomes,BRD4,fs(1)h","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/69.full"

It is thus pressing to look for the optimization of selection schemes to grow species mixtures, and especially recurrent selection schemes which are at the core of the improvement of many plant species. We considered the case of two populations from different species to be improved by recurrent selection for their performances in mixture. We set up an analytical model of performances in mixture. We expressed the expected responses of the performances in mixture to one cycle of selection in the case of a Reciprocal Mixture Ability selection scheme and of two parallel selection schemes aiming to improve General Mixture Abilities or performances in pure stands. We numerically compared these selection schemes when half-sib or topcross progeny families of selection candidates are tested in mixture. Selection in pure stands appeared efficient within a limited range of genetic correlations between pure stand performance and mixture model effects. The Reciprocal Mixture Ability selection scheme was expected to be less efficient than parallel selections for General Mixture Ability in some situations. The last option enables to control the ratio of expected responses of species contributions to the mixture performance without bias when using selection indices. When more than two species are be improved for their performances in mixture, the advantage of parallel selections for General Mixture Ability is even more marked, providing that compensation trends between species are not too prevalent.","Progeny,family,test,Response,to,selection,Reciprocal,mixture,ability,General,mixture,ability,Selection,index","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/89.full"

Autophagy also removes misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, a critical mechanism for cellular repair. Earlier work demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans, an abundant class of carbohydrate-modified proteins found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, suppress basal levels of autophagy in several cell types during development in Drosophila melanogaster. In studies reported here, we examined the capacity of heparan sulfate synthesis to influence events affected by autophagy, including lifespan, resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress, and accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brain. Compromising heparan sulfate synthesis increased autophagy-dependent processes, evident by extended lifespan, increased resistance to ROS, and reduced accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brains of ROS exposed adults. The capacity of altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis to protect cells from injury was also evaluated in two different models of neurodegeneration, overexpression of Presenilin and parkin mutants. Presenilin overexpression in the retina produces cell loss, and compromising heparan sulfate biosynthesis rescued retinal patterning and size abnormalities in these animals. parkin is the fly homolog of human PARK2, one of the genes responsible for juvenile onset Parkinson’s Disease. Parkin is involved in mitochondrial surveillance and compromising parkin function results in degeneration of both flight muscle and dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila. Altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis suppressed flight muscle degeneration and mitochondrial dysmorphology, indicating that activation of autophagy-mediated removal of mitochondria (mitophagy) is potentiated in these animals. These findings provide in vivo evidence that altering the levels of heparan sulfate synthesis activates autophagy and can provide protection from a variety of cellular stressors.","heparan,sulfate,modified,proteins,autophagy,mitophagy,parkin,presenilin","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/129.full"

However, RNA-seq library preparation is still prohibitive for many laboratories. Recently, the field of single-cell transcriptomics has reduced costs and increased throughput by adopting early barcoding and pooling of individual samples —producing a single final library containing all samples. In contrast, RNA-seq protocols where each sample is processed individually are significantly more expensive and lower throughput than single-cell approaches. Yet, many projects depend on individual library generation to preserve important samples or for follow-up re-sequencing experiments. Improving on currently available RNA-seq methods we have developed TM3'seq, a 3'-enriched library preparation protocol that uses Tn5 transposase and preserves sample identity at each step. TM3'seq is designed for high-throughput processing of individual samples (96 samples in 6h, with only 3h hands-on time) at a fraction of the cost of commercial kits ($1.5 per sample). The protocol was tested in a range of human and Drosophila melanogaster RNA samples, recovering transcriptomes of the same quality and reliability than the commercial NEBNext kit. We expect that the cost- and time-efficient features of TM3'seq make large-scale RNA-seq experiments more permissive for the entire scientific community.","RNAseq,mRNA,extraction,Transcriptomics,TagSeq,TM3seq","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/143.full"

The most common cause of death in people with SSc is lung disease, but the pathogenesis of lung disease in SSc is insufficiently understood to devise specific treatment strategies. Developing targeted treatments requires not only the identification of molecular processes involved in SSc-associated lung disease, but also understanding of how these processes interact to drive pathology. One potentially powerful approach is to identify alleles that interact genetically to influence lung outcomes in patients with SSc. Analysis of interactions, rather than individual allele effects, has the potential to delineate molecular interactions that are important in SSc-related lung pathology. However, detecting genetic interactions, or epistasis, in human cohorts is challenging. Large numbers of variants with low minor allele frequencies, paired with heterogeneous disease presentation, reduce power to detect epistasis. Here we present an analysis that increases power to detect epistasis in human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We tested for genetic interactions influencing lung function and autoantibody status in a cohort of 416 SSc patients. Using Matrix Epistasis to filter SNPs followed by the Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis (CAPE), we identified a network of interacting alleles influencing lung function in patients with SSc. In particular, we identified a three-gene network comprising WNT5A, RBMS3, and MSI2, which in combination influenced multiple pulmonary pathology measures. The associations of these genes with lung outcomes in SSc are novel and high-confidence.

In some instances, parents are able to transmit immune priming to their offspring, creating a subsequent generation with a superior immune capability, through processes that are not yet fully understood. Using a parasitoid wasp, which infects larval stages of Drosophila melanogaster, we describe an example of an intergenerational inheritance of immune priming. This phenomenon is anticipatory in nature and does not rely on parental infection, but rather, when adult fruit flies are cohabitated with a parasitic wasp, they produce offspring that are more capable of mounting a successful immune response against a parasitic macro-infection. This increase in offspring survival correlates with a more rapid induction of lamellocytes, a specialized immune cell. RNA-sequencing of the female germline identifies several differentially expressed genes following wasp exposure, including the peptiodoglycan recognition protein-LB (PGRP-LB). We find that genetic manipulation of maternal PGRP-LB identifies this gene as a key element in this intergenerational phenotype.","immune,priming,immunity,intergenerational,leptopilina,heterotoma,leptopilina,victoriae,PGRP-LB,transgenerational","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/165.full"

Most imputation algorithms were originally developed for the use in human genetics and thus are optimized for a high level of genetic diversity. Different versions of BEAGLE were evaluated on genetic datasets of doubled haploids of two European maize landraces, a commercial breeding line and a diversity panel in chicken, respectively, with different levels of genetic diversity and structure which can be taken into account in BEAGLE by parameter tuning. Especially for phasing BEAGLE 5.0 outperformed the newest version (5.1) which in turn also lead to improved imputation. Earlier versions were far more dependent on the adaption of parameters in all our tests. For all versions, the parameter ne (effective population size) had a major effect on the error rate for imputation of ungenotyped markers, reducing error rates by up to 98.5%. Further improvement was obtained by tuning of the parameters affecting the structure of the haplotype cluster that is used to initialize the underlying Hidden Markov Model of BEAGLE. The number of markers with extremely high error rates for the maize datasets were more than halved by the use of a flint reference genome (F7, PE0075 etc.) instead of the commonly used B73. On average, error rates for imputation of ungenotyped markers were reduced by 8.5% by excluding genetically distant individuals from the reference panel for the chicken diversity panel. To optimize imputation accuracy one has to find a balance between representing as much of the genetic diversity as possible while avoiding the introduction of noise by including genetically distant individuals.","imputation,BEAGLE,reference,panel,reference,genome","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/177.full"

Such crucial environmental inputs include metabolic cues derived from microbes living together with animals. Thus, the analysis of genetic effects on animals’ physiology can be confounded by variations in the metabolic profile of microbes. Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to distinct bacterial strains and species exhibit phenotypes different at cellular, developmental, and behavioral levels. Here we reported metabolomic profiles of three Escherichia coli strains, B strain OP50, K-12 strain MG1655, and B-K-12 hybrid strain HB101, as well as different mitochondrial and fat storage phenotypes of C. elegans exposed to MG1655 and HB101 vs. OP50. We found that these metabolic phenotypes of C. elegans are not correlated with overall metabolic patterning of bacterial strains, but their specific metabolites. In particular, the fat storage phenotype is traced to the betaine level in different bacterial strains. HT115 is another K-12 E. coli strain that is commonly utilized to elicit an RNA interference response, and we showed that C. elegans exposed to OP50 and HT115 exhibit differences in mitochondrial morphology and fat storage levels. We thus generated an RNA interference competent OP50 (iOP50) strain that can robustly and consistently knockdown endogenous C. elegans genes in different tissues. Together, these studies suggest the importance of specific bacterial metabolites in regulating the host’s physiology and provide a tool to prevent confounding effects when analyzing genotype-phenotype interactions under different bacterial backgrounds.","Metabolomics,microbe-host,interaction,metabolism,RNA,interference,C.,elegans","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/189.full"

UNC79 and UNC80 are key regulators of the channel function. However, the behavioral effects of the channel complex are not entirely clear and the neurons in which the channel functions remain to be identified. In a forward genetic screen for C. elegans mutants with defective avoidance response to the plant hormone methyl salicylate (MeSa), we isolated multiple loss-of-function mutations in unc-80 and unc-79. C. elegans NALCN mutants exhibited similarly defective MeSa avoidance. Interestingly, NALCN, unc-80 and unc-79 mutants all showed wild type-like responses to other attractive or repelling odorants, suggesting that NALCN does not broadly affect odor detection or related forward and reversal behaviors. To understand in which neurons the channel functions, we determined the identities of a subset of unc-80-expressing neurons. We found that unc-79 and unc-80 are expressed and function in overlapping neurons, which verified previous assumptions. Neuron-specific transgene rescue and knockdown experiments suggest that the command interneurons AVA and AVE and the anterior guidepost neuron AVG can play a sufficient role in mediating unc-80 regulation of the MeSa avoidance. Though primarily based on genetic analyses, our results further imply that MeSa might activate NALCN by direct or indirect actions. Altogether, we provide an initial look into the key neurons in which the NALCN channel complex functions and identify a novel function of the channel in regulating C. elegans reversal behavior through command interneurons.","UNC-80,UNC-79,NCA,NALCN,MeSa,avoidance","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/199.full"

The history of population-size change experienced by a sample of polymorphisms can then be dissected in a model-flexible fashion, and extension of this theory allows estimation of the mean and full distribution of long-term effective population sizes and ages of alleles of specific frequencies.

The age at which an individual reaches sexual maturity is an important fitness trait in many wild species. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating maturation timing processes remain obscure. A recent genome-wide association study in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) identified large-effect age-at-maturity-associated chromosomal regions including genes vgll3, akap11 and six6, which have roles in adipogenesis, spermatogenesis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, respectively. Here, we determine expression patterns of these genes during salmon development and their potential molecular partners and pathways. Using Nanostring transcription profiling technology, we show development- and tissue-specific mRNA expression patterns for vgll3, akap11 and six6. Correlated expression levels of vgll3 and akap11, which have adjacent chromosomal location, suggests they may have shared regulation. Further, vgll3 correlating with arhgap6 and yap1, and akap11 with lats1 and yap1 suggests that Vgll3 and Akap11 take part in actin cytoskeleton regulation. Tissue-specific expression results indicate that vgll3 and akap11 paralogs have sex-dependent expression patterns in gonads. Moreover, six6 correlating with slc38a6 and rtn1, and Hippo signaling genes suggests that Six6 could have a broader role in the HPG neuroendrocrine and cell fate commitment regulation, respectively. We conclude that Vgll3, Akap11 and Six6 may influence Atlantic salmon maturation timing via affecting adipogenesis and gametogenesis by regulating cell fate commitment and the HPG axis. These results may help to unravel general molecular mechanisms behind maturation.","Atlantic,salmon,maturation,process,vgll3,mRNA,expression,cell,fate,regulation","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/235.full"

Investigations of the molecular mechanisms of this predatory beetle have been hindered by the scarcity of gene sequence data. To obtain gene sequences for the ladybird beetle and determine differences in gene expression between the summer and winter seasons, paired-end sequencing was performed. Real-time PCR was used to validate differences in Krueppel homolog 1 gene (Kr-h1) mRNA expression in summer vs. winter samples. To determined the diversity of the population, annotated cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COX1) gene fragments were amplified from several ladybird beetle populations. The analysis yielded 191,246 assembled unigenes, 127,016 of which (66.4%) were annotated. These functional annotations of gene sequences are currently available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and will provide a basis for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological characteristics of S. japonicum. We found a change in expression of ribosome-associated genes across seasons, and postulate that this change is because of seasonal variation in temperature and photoperiod. The differential expression of Kr-h1 suggests that S. japonicum can successfully overwinter because the adults enter diapause. To explain the effects of season on Kr-h1 gene expression, we hypothesize a model in which that a short photoperiod affects the density of Ca2+, the subsequent activity of methyl farnesoate epoxidase and the synthesis of JH, and in turn Kr-h1 gene expression. COX1 annotation was concordant with the morphological ID. The same COX1 sequence was found in the samples from several provinces in China. Therefore, the COX1 sequence is worth further study to distinguish beetle species and populations.","Serangium,japonicum,RNA,sequencing,de,novo,assembly,overwinter,ladybird,beetle","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/247.full"

Our data indicate that Tos4 localization in these conditions is responsive to checkpoint kinases, with activation of the Cds1 checkpoint kinase promoting Tos4 retention in the nucleus, and activation of the Chk1 damage checkpoint promoting its turnover.

The auxin-inducible degradation system allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation via a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate-recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID system by utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 min of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 depends on C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins.

We also found that expression of sox5, pax7a, pax3a, and mitfa genes is down-regulated in both fm and kitlga knockout medaka, implicating c-Kit signaling in regulation of the expression of these genes as well as the encoded transcription factors in pigment cell specification. Our results may provide insight into the pathogenesis of c-Kit–related pigmentation disorders such as piebaldism in humans, and our kitlga knockout medaka may prove useful as a tool for drug screening.","medaka,few,melanophore,mutant,kit-ligand,melanophore,leucophore","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/311.full"

To determine the role of constraint loss on cis element evolution, we examined the recent appearance of a thiamine starvation regulated promoter in Candida glabrata. This species lacks the ancestral transcription factor Thi2, but still has the transcription factor Pdc2, which regulates thiamine starvation genes, allowing us to determine the effect of constraint change on a new promoter. We identified two different cis elements in C. glabrata - one present in the evolutionarily recent gene called CgPMU3, and the other element present in the other thiamine (THI) regulated genes. Reciprocal swaps of the cis elements and incorporation of the S. cerevisiae Thi2 transcription factor-binding site into these promoters demonstrate that the two elements are functionally different from one another. Thus, this loss of an imposed constraint on promoter function has generated a novel cis sequence, suggesting that loss of trans constraints can generate a non-convergent pathway with the same output.","thiamine,Candida,glabrata,PDC2,THI2,cis,evolution","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/321.full"

In the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, the endoderm (gut) is generated from a single embryonic precursor, E. Gut is specified by the maternal factor SKN-1, which activates the MED <U+2192> END-1,3 <U+2192> ELT-2,7 cascade of GATA transcription factors. In this work, genome sequences from over two dozen species within the Caenorhabditis genus are used to identify MED and END-1,3 orthologs. Predictions are validated by comparison of gene structure, protein conservation, and putative cis-regulatory sites. All three factors occur together, but only within the Elegans supergroup, suggesting they originated at its base. The MED factors are the most diverse and exhibit an unexpectedly extensive gene amplification. In contrast, the highly conserved END-1 orthologs are unique in nearly all species and share extended regions of conservation. The END-1,3 proteins share a region upstream of their zinc finger and an unusual amino-terminal poly-serine domain exhibiting high codon bias. Compared with END-1, the END-3 proteins are otherwise less conserved as a group and are typically found as paralogous duplicates. Hence, all three factors are under different evolutionary constraints. Promoter comparisons identify motifs that suggest the SKN-1, MED, and END factors function in a similar gut specification network across the Elegans supergroup that has been conserved for tens of millions of years. A model is proposed to account for the rapid origin of this essential kernel in the gut specification network, by the upstream intercalation of duplicate genes into a simpler ancestral network.","GATA,factors,cell,fate,specification,gene,regulatory,network,developmental,system,drift,Caenorhabditis","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/333.full"

Cycloheximide chase experiments ruled out the possibility that the increased steady-state level of Pdr5 was caused by increased protein stability. Quantitative-RT PCR experiments demonstrated that the mutants had levels of PDR5 transcript that were two to three times as high as in the isogenic wild-type strain. Further experiments employing metabolic labeling of mRNA with 4-thiouracil followed by uracil chasing showed that the half-life of PDR5 transcripts was specifically increased in these mutants.

In addition to its role in the biosynthesis of critical metabolites, it plays crucial roles in the regeneration of the reduced forms of glutathione, thioredoxins and peroxiredoxins. The enzymes and pathways that regulate NADPH are thus extremely important to understand, and yet are only partially understood. We have been interested in understanding how NADPH fluxes are altered in the cell. We describe here both an assay and a genetic screen that allows one to discern changes in NADPH levels. The screen exploits the secondary redox property of NADPH. At low levels of glutathione we show that the redox contributions of NADPH become critical for growth, and we have used this to develop a genetic screen for genes affecting NADPH homeostasis. The screen was validated in pathways that both directly (pentose phosphate pathway) and indirectly (glycolytic pathway) affect NADPH levels, and was then exploited to identify mitochondrial genes that affect NADPH homeostasis. A total of 239 mitochondrial gene knockouts were assayed using this screen. Among these, several genes were predicted to play a role in NADPH homeostasis. This included several new genes of unknown function, and others of poorly defined function. We examined two of these genes, FMP40 which encodes a protein required during oxidative stress and GOR1, glyoxylate reductase. Our studies throw new light on these proteins that appear to be major consumers of NADPH in the cell. The genetic screen is thus predicted to be an exceedingly useful tool for investigating NADPH homeostasis.","NADPH,Glutathione,Saccharomyces,cerevisiae,Mitochondria,Genetic,screen","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/371.full"

However, studies on genomic information of Guangxi indigenous chicken to date remain poorly explored. To decipher the population genetic structure and differentially selected regions (DSRs) in Guangxi indigenous chickens, we dug into numerous SNPs from seven Guangxi native chickens (GX) by employing the restriction site associated with DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) technology. Another three breeds, Cobb, White Leghorn, and Chahua (CH) chicken, were used as a control. After quality control, a total of 185,117 autosomal SNPs were kept for further analysis. The results showed a significant difference in population structure, and the control breeds were distinctly separate from the Guangxi native breeds, which was also strongly supported by the phylogenetic tree. Distribution of FST indicated that there were three SNPs with big genetic differentiation (FST value all reach to 0. 9427) in GX vs. CH group, which were located on chr1-96,859,720,chr4-86,139,601, and chr12-8,128,322, respectively. Besides, we identified 717 DSRs associated with 882 genes in GX vs. Cobb group, 769 DSRs with 476 genes in GX vs. Leghorn group, and 556 DSRs with 779 genes in GX vs. CH group. GO enrichment showed that there were two significant terms, namely GPI-linked ephrin receptor activity and BMP receptor binding, which were enriched in GX vs. Leghorn group. In conclusion, this study suggests that Guangxi native chickens have a great differentiation with Cobb and Leghorn. Our findings would be beneficial to fully evaluate the genomic information on Guangxi native chicken and facilitate the application of these resources in chicken breeding.","DSRs,Guangxi,Native,Breeds,Population,Structure,RAD-seq","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/379.full"

However, this was only tested in the rodent and fly model systems. Akirin was shown to act with chromatin remodeling complexes in transcription and was established as a downstream target of the NF<U+03BA>B pathway. Here we show a role for Caenorhabditis elegans Akirin/AKIR-1 in the muscle and body length regulation through a different pathway. Akirin localizes to somatic tissues throughout the body of C. elegans, including muscle nuclei. In agreement with its role in other model systems, Akirin loss of function mutants exhibit defects in muscle development in the embryo, as well as defects in movement and maintenance of muscle integrity in the C. elegans adult. We also have determined that Akirin acts downstream of the TGF-ß Sma/Mab signaling pathway in controlling body size. Moreover, we found that the loss of Akirin resulted in an increase in autophagy markers, similar to mutants in the TGF-ß Sma/Mab signaling pathway. In contrast to what is known in rodent and fly models, C. elegans Akirin does not act with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and is instead involved with the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex in both movement and regulation of body size. Our studies define a novel developmental role (body size) and a new pathway (TGF-ß Sma/Mab) for Akirin function, and confirmed its evolutionarily conserved function in muscle development in a new organism.","C.,elegans,Akirin,AKIR-1,TGF-ß,Sma/Mab","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/387.full"

Recent advances have been made to our understanding of one case: pheromone preference evolution between the species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Males of both species are very sensitive to the pheromone 7,11-HD that is present only on the cuticle of female D. melanogaster. In one species this cue activates courtship, and in the other it represses it. This change in valence was recently shown to result from the modification of central processing neurons, rather than changes in peripherally expressed receptors, but nothing is known about the genetic changes that are responsible. In the current study, we show that a 1.35 Mb locus on the X chromosome has a major effect on male 7,11-HD preference. Unfortunately, when this locus is divided, the effect is largely lost. We instead attempt to filter the 159 genes within this region using our newfound understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of this phenotype to identify and test candidate genes. We present the results of these tests, and discuss the difficulty of identifying the genetic architecture of behavioral traits and the potential of connecting these genetic changes to the neuronal modifications that elicit different behaviors.","male,mate,choice,pheromones,courtship,behavior,reproductive,isolation,behavioral,genetics","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/401.full"

This variation may contribute to complex traits such as lifespan and disease, yet it is only infrequently considered in genotype-phenotype associations. Although the possible importance of copy number variation is widely recognized, accurate copy number quantification remains challenging. Here, we assess the technical reproducibility of several major methods for copy number estimation as they apply to the large repetitive ribosomal DNA array (rDNA). rDNA encodes the ribosomal RNAs and exists as a tandem gene array in all eukaryotes. Repeat units of rDNA are kilobases in size, often with several hundred units comprising the array, making rDNA particularly intractable to common quantification techniques. We evaluate pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, droplet digital PCR, and Nextera-based whole genome sequencing as approaches to copy number estimation, comparing techniques across model organisms and spanning wide ranges of copy numbers. Nextera-based whole genome sequencing, though commonly used in recent literature, produced high error. We explore possible causes for this error and provide recommendations for best practices in rDNA copy number estimation. We present a resource of high-confidence rDNA copy number estimates for a set of S. cerevisiae and C. elegans strains for future use. We furthermore explore the possibility for FISH-based copy number estimation, an alternative that could potentially characterize copy number on a cellular level.","Ribosomal,DNA,Repetitive,DNA,Whole,Genome,Sequencing,Copy,Number,Variation","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/417.full"

Sex differences vary across strains, but many molecular studies focus on only a single strain, or on genes that show sexually dimorphic expression in many strains. How extensive variability is and whether this variability occurs among genes regulated by sex determination hierarchy terminal transcription factors is unknown. To address these questions, we examine differences in sexually dimorphic gene expression between two strains in Drosophila adult head tissues. We also examine gene expression in doublesex (dsx) mutant strains to determine which sex-differentially expressed genes are regulated by DSX, and the mode by which DSX regulates expression. We find substantial variation in sex-differential expression. The sets of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in each strain show little overlap. The prevalence of different DSX regulatory modes also varies between the two strains. Neither the patterns of DSX DNA occupancy, nor mode of DSX regulation explain why some genes show consistent sex-differential expression across strains. We find that the genes identified as regulated by DSX in this study are enriched with known sites of DSX DNA occupancy. Finally, we find that sex-differentially expressed genes and genes regulated by DSX are highly enriched on the fourth chromosome. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.","sex,determination,Drosophila,sex,hierarchy,doublesex,transcriptome,gene,expression,sex,bias,RNA-seq,Genetics,of,Sex","https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/7/1799.full"

The auxin-inducible degradation system allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation via a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate-recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID system by utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 min of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 depends on C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins. Finally, we present highly penetrant defects from NAA-mediated degradation of the FTZ-F1 nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-25, during C. elegans uterine-vulval development. Together, this work improves our use and understanding of the AID system for dissecting gene function at the single-cell level during C. elegans development.","C.,elegans,AID,system,synthetic,auxin,microfluidics,SCF,complex,NHR-25","https://www.g3journal.org/content/10/1/267.full"
